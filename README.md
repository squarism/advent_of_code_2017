# Advent of Code 2017

Learning Elm.  Quite a challenge.

For most of these, you should have elm installed `brew install elm` or equiv.

```
cd day01
elm package install
elm test --watch   # run tests
elm reactor start  # browse to localhost:8080/src/Main.elm
                   # these paths might change from day to day, challenge to challenge
```
